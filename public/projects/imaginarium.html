                <p>
                    <em>Imaginarium</em> is a program created by 
                    <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/horswill-ian.html" target="_blank">Dr. Ian Horswill</a>
                    designed to generate any fictional entity one could imagine for purposes such as (but not limited to) story creation, narrative development, 
                    and tabletop roleplaying games. I stumbled upon this project when taking a special topics in computer science class with him
                    that focused on the role of AI in narrative-based games. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were asked to use Imaginarium to generate some characters and write a quick story. I was immediately hooked and intrigued by
                    the fact that the "code" one writes in Imaginarium is complete English. There is no fancy notation or syntax to learn, which
                    is what makes such a tool so powerful - it is accessible to anyone, regardless of coding experience. For reference, here is 
                    what an example of my code looks like:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img class="back" src="../pictures/imaginarium sample code.webp">
                <img class="front" src="../pictures/imaginarium sample code.webp">
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    In addition to generating entities, Imaginarium can also be used to generate relationships between said entities. If you were
                    to generate characters, you could write something like "characters can love each other," and then generating at least two characters
                    would result in a graph of characters with edges between them representing the relationship. Here's an example of such a relationship
                    graph:
                </p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    It happened to be the case that I was also starting to take interest in pursuing a combined degree
                    (B.A. and M.S. in Computer Science) at Northwestern University, and reached out to Dr. Horswill to see if I could
                    take a graduate-level research projects class with him as my advisor. Eventually, I decided I would work on expanding
                    Imaginarium's capabilities, in particular looking at the core of the code and the SAT solver that is used to generate
                    constraint-based models.
                </p>
                <h4>Features Implemented:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Better gerund support (e.g., being able to say something like "happily being married is a way of knowing") for relationships</li>
                    <li>Expanded domain and codomain for verbs in relationships to allow entities to relate to more than one other kind of entity</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Features to Implement:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>An "exists" predicate</li>
                    <li>An easier way to generate multiple different kinds of entities at the same time</li>
                    <li>Negation of verbs (e.g., "cannot," "must not," etc.)</li>
                    <li>Improved UI of the Unity implementation</li>
                    <li>More robust documentation</li>
                </ul>
