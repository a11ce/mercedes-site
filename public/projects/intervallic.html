                    <em>Intervallic</em> is Overture Games' first title. The game itself is a 2D runner that
                    allows users to play their instrument to control an alien-robot-space cat and navigate through
                    a level, dodging obstacles and collecting traces and samples. The notes that are played
                    correspond to vertical movement of the cat. For example, playing up on a scale allows the cat
                    to move vertically upward, and playing down on a scale moves the cat vertically downward. This
                    way, by the end of the level, the user has played through an entire song. The game currently
                    allows input from any Midi device as well as computer keyboard and mouse. We aim to implement touch
                    screen input as well as generic audio input, so anyone with any instrument could play the game. You play
                    as Starburst, a nerdy music-lover working to explore strange planets with her companion robot cat (who
                    the player controls with their instrument). As you continue playing, you make new friends and play 
                    more fun songs.

                    Overture currently has five members, and I am one of two software developers. Despite this, I have 
                    learned so much about the other aspects of game development, such as art, music, design, and marketing.
