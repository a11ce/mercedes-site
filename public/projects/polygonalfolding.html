                    <em>Intervallic</em> is Overture Games' first title. The game itself is a 2D runner that
                    allows users to play their instrument to control an alien-robot-space cat and navigate through
                    a level, dodging obstacles and collecting traces and samples. The notes that are played
                    correspond to vertical movement of the cat. For example, playing up on a scale allows the cat
                    to move vertically upward, and playing down on a scale moves the cat vertically downward. This
                    way, by the end of the level, the user has played through an entire song. The game currently
                    allows input from any Midi device as well as computer keyboard and mouse. We aim to implement touch
                    screen input as well as generic audio input, so anyone with any instrument could play the game. You play
                    as Starburst, a nerdy music-lover working to explore strange planets with her companion robot cat (who
                    the player controls with their instrument). As you continue playing, you make new friends and play 
                    more fun songs.

                    Overture currently has five members, and I am one of two software developers. Despite this, I have 
                    learned so much about the other aspects of game development, such as art, music, design, and marketing.
                    As a software developer, I have been primarily in charge of designing and implementing the main game 
                    mechanics and features as well as majority of the frontend aspects (UI/UX). In particular, I've programmed
                    things like player movement, main menu and pause menu, collectibles, obstacles, and in game UI. There are
                    also two particular systems which I have been developing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A key signature and note system to be used with player input and level management/building</li>
                    <li>An accuracy and statistics system to be used for live feedback during gameplay and musical practice reports</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Through Overture and working on <em>Intervallic</em>, I have discovered how much I like startup environments
                    and agile software development. It has been a great experience to work with a small team and undergo the
                    fast-paced development process. I am continuing to work part-time during the academic year to fulfill whatever 
                    will be needed for our early release.
                </p>
